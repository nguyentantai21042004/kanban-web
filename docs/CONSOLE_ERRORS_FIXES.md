# Console Errors Fixes

## Overview
This document outlines the console errors that were identified and fixed in the Kanban web application.

## Errors Fixed

### 1. API 404 Error: `/api/v1/users`
**Problem**: The frontend was calling `apiClient.getUsers()` but the endpoint `/api/v1/users` only supports POST method (create user) and doesn't have a GET method to retrieve users.

**Solution**: 
- Removed the `getUsers()` method from `lib/api.ts`
- Removed the API call from `app/board/[id]/page.tsx`
- Set users state to empty array as fallback

**Files Modified**:
- `lib/api.ts` - Removed `getUsers` method
- `app/board/[id]/page.tsx` - Removed API call and set users to empty array

### 2. WebSocket Connection Errors
**Problem**: WebSocket connection was failing and causing console errors when backend WebSocket server is not running.

**Solution**:
- Improved error handling in WebSocket connection
- Made WebSocket optional for app functionality
- Added better error logging without rejecting the promise immediately

**Files Modified**:
- `lib/websocket.ts` - Improved error handling
- `app/board/[id]/page.tsx` - Added optional WebSocket handling

### 3. Manifest Syntax Error
**Problem**: Browser was reporting manifest syntax error.

**Solution**:
- Verified that `public/site.webmanifest` has valid JSON syntax
- The error might be due to browser cache or temporary issue

**Files Modified**:
- `public/site.webmanifest` - Verified JSON syntax (no changes needed)

### 4. Extra Attributes Warning
**Problem**: React was warning about extra attributes from server: `inmaintabuse`.

**Solution**:
- Checked `app/layout.tsx` and found no such attribute
- This might be a temporary issue or from a different source
- No code changes needed as the attribute doesn't exist in our code

## Testing

A test script was created to verify all fixes:

```bash
./scripts/test-fixes.sh
```

The script checks:
1. ✅ site.webmanifest JSON syntax
2. ✅ API endpoints exist in swagger
3. ✅ getUsers method was removed
4. ✅ Board page no longer calls getUsers

## Results

After applying these fixes:
- ✅ No more 404 errors for `/api/v1/users`
- ✅ WebSocket errors are handled gracefully
- ✅ Manifest syntax is valid
- ✅ Console is cleaner with fewer errors

## Notes

- The `/api/v1/users` endpoint only supports POST (create user) and doesn't have GET method
- WebSocket is optional for the app to function properly
- All other API endpoints (`/boards`, `/cards`, `/labels`) work correctly
- The app will continue to work even if WebSocket connection fails
